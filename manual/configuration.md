# Prerequisites

It's a pure web project so you will need every common browser like `chrome`, `firefox`,...
setup as you want but it's necessary to have `redux dev tools` and a good knowledge of your inspector.

## IDE

You can choose the IDE you whant, but you need to have some packages installed with it like `ESLint` for the live linter, and some `React` packages to get autocompletion.
Here an exemple of the needed packages with Visual Studio Code IDE:

- `Reactjs code snippets`
- `ESLint`

## Node / Npm

Since it's a JS-Based project, due to ReactJs you need to install some stuff on your computer:

- macOS:
  Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as package manager and install the following dependencies:

```bash
brew install node
brew install npm
```

---

- Windows:
  Note that you can't run iOS app on windows.
  Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) as package manager and install the following dependencies:

```bash
choco install -y nodejs.install python2 jdk8 npm
